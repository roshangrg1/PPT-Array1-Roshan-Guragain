## Absolute
Absolute: It is property that allows to position an element relative to its parent element or, if no parent present then relative to its body.
It uses property like top, left , right , bottom.

## Relative
Relative: It is a property that allows to position an element relative to its normal position.
But the element stills occupies space in the document flow and other element are aware of it.
It does not affect the position of other element.

## Fixed
Fixed: It is a property that allows to position an element relative to its position of its browser window / parent element

## Sticky
Sticky: It is a hybrid of a relative and fixed . Here element behaves relatively until it reached a defined top/bottom/left/right  after it becomes fixed . It becomes fixed to the container until it reaches the threshold again.
